## 1. **Prebuilt VirtualBox CTF Lab Template (Download & Setup)**

I'll guide you through creating one manually, but if you prefer a prebuilt OVA file (ready-to-import VM), I can also share instructions to build it.

### 🔧 Manual Setup:

### 🔹 Vulnerable Machine (DVWA):

1. **Install Docker:**
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    sudo apt install docker.io
    
    ```
    
2. **Run DVWA locally:**
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa
    
    ```
    
3. Access from browser:
    
    ```
    cpp
    CopyEdit
    http://127.0.0.1:8080
    
    ```
    

### 🔹 Attacker Machine (Kali Linux VM):

- Install Kali Linux in VirtualBox
- Tools to install:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install burpsuite sqlmap gobuster wfuzz zaproxy
    
    ```

## 🛡️ 2. **OPSEC Check Script (Linux)**

This Bash script checks:

- If you're using Tor
- If MAC address is spoofed
- If DNS leaks are possible
- If JavaScript is disabled (Tor Browser)

### 📜 `opsec_check.sh`

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
#!/bin/bash

echo "[*] Checking if Tor service is running..."
systemctl is-active --quiet tor && echo "[✔] Tor is active" || echo "[✘] Tor is not running"

echo "[*] Checking current IP (via Tor):"
proxychains curl -s https://icanhazip.com

echo "[*] Checking DNS leaks (should not show your ISP DNS):"
proxychains dig +short whoami.akamai.net @ns1-1.akamaitech.net

echo "[*] Checking MAC address:"
ip link show | grep ether

echo "[*] Reminder: Check your browser manually for JavaScript, fingerprinting, and cookie behavior."

echo "[!] Done. Remember: OPSEC is a habit, not a script."

```

> Save it as opsec_check.sh, then:
> 

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
chmod +x opsec_check.sh
./opsec_check.sh

```

## 🎯 3. **Mini CTF Challenge (Realistic Tracking Trap)**

**Scenario:**

You're given the URL:

```
arduino
CopyEdit
http://ctf-lab.local/robots.txt

```

It reveals:

```
bash
CopyEdit
Disallow: /admin_panel
Disallow: /secret_upload
Disallow: /logs/backups.zip

```

You must:

1. Access `/admin_panel` and look for login bypass
2. Download and analyze `backups.zip`
3. Avoid triggering the JS honeypot in `/secret_upload`

### Flag Locations:

- `flag1.txt` inside `backups.zip`
- A successful SQL injection in `/admin_panel`
- Visiting `/secret_upload?auth=admin` triggers JS beacon unless JS is blocked

## 🚀 Next Steps for You

Would you like me to:

- Help you build this entire lab using scripts?
- Send a ZIP of the preconfigured vulnerable web app and attacker notes?
- Design a scoreboard interface for your personal CTF?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed — I can generate scripts or full setups right here.
