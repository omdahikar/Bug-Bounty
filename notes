1. nmap -A -F -T1 10.10.10.223 -v
2. fuzz thesting

ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlist/disb/common.txt -u http://tenet.htb/FUZZ -fc 403 -p 2

//not using 403 pages and using slowly on 2 we can make it -p 1 very slow

1. github seclist is very good
2. use shodhan for recon

shodhan on terminal install first

then

shodan init <api key>

shodan info

shodan scan -h

shodan count wordpress

shodan count wordpress 1.4.7

shodan download wordpressfile "wordpress 1.4.7"

apt intall gedit  --> web json viewer

gunzip wordpressfile.json.zip

gedit wordpressfile.json

host yahoo.com -->range of ip addresses running

ping yahoo.com --> for ip

burp instercept --> for ip

shodan host <ip of website>

shodan scan submit <ip>

bgp.he.net

shodan cheat sheet

cherry tree for notes taking

wapalizer for versions

write all the notes very important

https://sub.domain.com/blog/article/search?param=42

wfuzz for subdomain fuzzing

we can also fuzz for directories

https://howdns.works/ep4/

dig axfir @<ip> friendzone >zone

dig axfir @<ip> friendzoneportal.red >>zone --> append to zone file

cat zone | grep friendzone | grep IN | awk '{print $1}'| sort

whois

nslookup

sublist3r

dirbuster

harvester -d (domainname) -b google

crt.sh --> for certificates of domain

wayback machine --> very important

for downloadig wayback machine we need go language

apt install golang

go install <githublink>

cd ~/go/bin

ls

./waybackurls -h

gedit yahoo.txt --> yahoo.com

cat yahoo.txt | ./waybackurls > yahoo.urls

amass enum -passive -d yahoo.com --> sub domain gives

gedit yahoo.txt --> paste all the subdomains

cat yahoo.txt | ./waybackurls > yahoo.urls

wc -l yahoo.urls

sudo apt install httprobe

work same as waybackmachine

cat yahoo.urls | httprobe > valid.urls

sublist3r -d yahoo.com

open multiple urls firefox extention is use to open multiple urls at a time

amass is way use full for many sub domains than sublist3r

https://w3techs.com/  --> for language used in website and version services

we can use inspect>debugger> js files

nmap -A -p35,445,135,139,80,443 <ip> -v

ffuf -u <url use FUZZ for acutual where to fuzz subdomain or directory> -w /usr/share/wordlist/dirb/common.txt -p 1 -fc <page error number you don't want like 301>

we can you fuff for api end point testing (dir of api)

dirb <url>

wpscan --help

wpscan --url <url> -e ap --plugins-detection aggressive

wpscan for wordpress applications

sudo nmap -f

sudo nmap -D RND:5

sudo nmap -D 192.168.1.1,..,..,..,ME 192.168.1.2

sudo nmap -S 8.8.8.8 -Pn -e th0 -g 7777

sudo nmap -sF

Sudo nmap --script auth <ip> -sS

Sudo nmap --script exploit <ip> -sS

tips

take newer programs to attack

take program with large scope

take program which you have interest into , so we learn more things

new members should take not paid bug programs

follow the developers on the social media which are realted to the program

when developer launch new sub domains and new area of website will post there code and services on github

sublist3r -d yahoo.com

ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt -u https://www.yahoo.com/FUZZ
